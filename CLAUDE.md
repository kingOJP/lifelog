# LiftLog — Claude Context

## Project goal

LiftLog is a Progressive Web App for tracking a 4-day bodybuilding split, installable on iPhone via "Add to Home Screen." The user is a first-time web app developer. The app lives at this repo and auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages on push to `main`.

Long-term milestones (roughly):
1. ✅ PWA shell + Cloudflare deployment
2. ✅ Dashboard with 4 day cards, week date range
3. ✅ Workout logging + IndexedDB persistence
4. ✅ Recommended weights (progressive overload) + inline set editing
5. ✅ History view + session editing
6. ✅ Day/exercise editing (add, remove, rename exercises per day)
7. ✅ Google OAuth login + cloud sync
8. ✅ Exercise metadata (muscle groups, equipment, weight type) + metrics dashboard
9. ✅ Progress charts (custom CSS bar/line charts)
10. ✅ Rest timer (auto-starts on logging a set; adjustable, with haptic buzz)
11. ✅ Data-driven coaching engine (`insights.ts`) — fractional weekly set-volume per
    muscle vs the 10–20 hard-set target, e1RM plateau/trend detection, prioritized
    recommendations + next-workout suggestion. Surfaced on the Dashboard (Coach card)
    and in Metrics (Coach section).
12. ✅ Configurable program start date (Settings screen) + week-over-week volume delta
13. ✅ Rev 2: double-progression recommendation engine with deload detection,
    shared analytics core (`analytics.ts`), Settings screen, "last time" context
    on exercise cards, Vitest test suite, worker payload validation

## Stack

- **React + Vite + TypeScript** — `npm run dev` to start, `npm run build` to build
- **Vitest + jsdom** — `npm test` (or `npm run test:watch`). Unit tests live next to the
  modules they cover (`src/data/*.test.ts`) and target the pure data layer.
- **IndexedDB** — via a custom `idbReq<T>` promise wrapper in `src/db/database.ts` (no third-party library). Read and write in **separate transactions** to avoid IDB auto-commit bugs; multi-record writes queue all requests synchronously on one transaction and await `txDone(tx)`.
- **localStorage** — for program config, exercise library, exercise metadata, settings, and migration flags. Managed in `src/data/programStore.ts`, `src/data/exercises.ts` and `src/data/settings.ts`.
- **Plain CSS** — no CSS framework, dark theme via CSS custom properties
- **Charts** — hand-rolled CSS/SVG `BarChart`/`LineChart` (no charting dependency)
- **Cloudflare Pages** — auto-deploys from GitHub `main` branch

---

## TypeScript rule — CRITICAL

`tsconfig.app.json` has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`. This means **all interface/type-only imports must use `import type`**:

```ts
import type { WorkoutDay } from '../data/program';   // ✅
import { WorkoutDay } from '../data/program';         // ❌ crashes at runtime in the browser
```

Value imports are fine as normal: `import { PROGRAM, getWeekNumber } from '../data/program'`.

## iPhone PWA safe area

All sticky headers use: `padding-top: calc(14px + env(safe-area-inset-top))`
Bottom bars use: `padding-bottom: calc(12px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
Scrollable lists add: `padding-bottom: calc(96px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`

All inputs use `font-size: 16px` to prevent iOS Safari zoom-on-focus.

---

## Auth

The app requires Google OAuth login. No content is shown until the user is authenticated.

- Login: `/api/auth/google` (Google OAuth redirect)
- Logout: `/api/auth/logout`
- Current user: `getLoggedInUser()` in `src/data/sync.ts` — reads from a cookie set by the server
- `LoginView` is shown when `getLoggedInUser()` returns null

---

## Navigation

No router — pure React state in `App.tsx`. The `View` discriminated union:

```ts
type View =
  | { screen: 'dashboard' }
  | { screen: 'workout'; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'history' }
  | { screen: 'edit-session'; sessionId: number; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'edit-day'; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'exercise-list' }
  | { screen: 'exercise-meta'; exerciseId: string; exerciseName: string }
  | { screen: 'metrics' }
  | { screen: 'settings' };
```

Day-scoped views (`workout`, `edit-session`, `edit-day`) look the day up with a fallback:
if the `dayId` no longer exists (program replaced by a sync), the app renders the
dashboard instead of crashing.

`program: WorkoutDay[]` state lives in `App.tsx`, initialized from `getStoredProgram()` (localStorage). On day edits it's updated and saved back.

## IndexedDB schema (version 3)

**`sessions`** — index: `weekNumber`
- `id` (autoincrement), `dayId`, `weekNumber`, `startedAt`, `completedAt?`

**`setLogs`** — index: `sessionId`
- `id`, `sessionId`, `exerciseId`, `setNumber`, `weight`, `reps`

**`exerciseLogs`** — index: `sessionId` (difficulty ratings — feature removed, store kept for compatibility)
- `id`, `sessionId`, `exerciseId`, `difficulty`

v2 added `exerciseMuscles` + `exerciseDetails` stores; v3 deleted them (metadata moved to localStorage).

Key exported functions: `createSession`, `completeSession`, `addSetLog`, `getSession`, `updateSessionDate`, `getCompletedSessionsForWeek`, `getSetLogsForSession`, `deleteSetLogsForSession`, `deleteSetLogsByExerciseId`, `hasSetLogsForExercise`, `migrateExerciseIds`, `dumpIDB`, `restoreIDB`.

Anything that *analyzes* history (dashboard, metrics, coaching, recommendations, history list) goes through `loadTrainingSnapshot()` in `data/analytics.ts` — one `dumpIDB()` read per screen, never per-session queries.

---

## Cloud sync

On app mount, `App.tsx` runs this sequence (only when logged in):
1. `migrateExerciseIds()` — fast local IDB fix, must run **before** WorkoutView reads logs
2. `pullSync()` — pulls server data into IDB + localStorage (clears and replaces)
3. `migrateExerciseIds()` again — in case pull restored old IDs from the server
4. `pushSync()` — if pull found nothing or any IDs were remapped

Sync payload includes: sessions, setLogs, exerciseLogs, program, exercise library.
Exercise metadata (`liftlog_exercise_meta`) is **not** synced — it's device-local.

---

## Progressive overload algorithm (`src/data/recommendations.ts`)

Runs when opening a new (non-edit) workout. WorkoutView loads one training snapshot and, for
each exercise, builds its recent history **across every day it appears in** (up to the last 3
sessions containing that exercise, newest first). `calculateRecommendation(history, exercise)`
implements **double progression** with stall detection, evaluated in order:

1. **Increase** — the last session had at least `exercise.sets` working sets and *every* one hit
   `repHigh`+ reps → add load. Increment = `max(5, round5(weight × 0.025))` (5 lbs normally,
   ~2.5% for heavy lifts like leg press).
2. **Deload** — 3+ consecutive sessions at the same working weight with no e1RM improvement
   (>1%) → drop ~10% and build back up.
3. **Decrease** — average working-set reps fell under `repLow` → ease back ~5%.
4. **Hold** (double progression) — reps are in range → keep the weight, chase reps until
   `sets × repHigh` earns the increase.

The **working weight** of a session is the most-used weight (tie → heaviest), so logged
warm-up/ramp-up sets don't skew the recommendation.

Returns `{ weight, direction, kind, reason }` (`kind`: `increase`/`hold`/`decrease`/`deload`).
ExerciseCard pre-fills the weight input (only while untouched) and shows the reason as a
colour-coded chip, plus a "Last time" line with the previous session's sets. The engine is fully
covered by `recommendations.test.ts`.

---

## Coaching engine (`src/data/insights.ts`)

`computeCoaching(program, snapshot)` takes a `TrainingSnapshot` (from `analytics.ts`) and produces:
- **Per-muscle weekly set volume** using *fractional* sets — a primary muscle counts as 1 hard set,
  each secondary muscle as 0.5 — scored against the 10–20 hard-set hypertrophy range
  (`low`/`optimal`/`high`). Muscle involvement resolves via override → master list → name match.
- **Strength trends** — best Epley e1RM per session per exercise; over the last 3 sessions a
  >±3% change is `up`/`down`, otherwise `flat` (a plateau).
- **Prioritized insights** — under-trained muscles, plateaus/declines, and a couple of "climbing"
  positives, capped at 6 and sorted by priority.
- **Next workout** — the program day longest since last trained.

Surfaced on the Dashboard (Coach card: next day + top insight) and Metrics (full Coach section).
`SETS_TARGET_LOW`/`SETS_TARGET_HIGH` are exported and shared with MetricsView.

---

## Exercise data architecture

`src/data/exercises.ts` is the single source of truth for the 28 built-in exercises:
- `EXERCISES: ExerciseDef[]` — id, name, primaryMuscle, secondaryMuscles, workoutType, equipment, weightType
- `EXERCISE_MAP: Map<string, ExerciseDef>` — fast lookup by id
- `getExerciseMeta(id)` — returns metadata, preferring user overrides from `liftlog_exercise_meta` over defaults
- `saveExerciseMeta(id, meta)` — writes user override to `liftlog_exercise_meta`

`src/data/program.ts` defines the 4-day `PROGRAM` with just id, name, sets, repLow, repHigh per exercise. It no longer contains `RETIRED_EXERCISES` — those are now in `EXERCISES` in exercises.ts.

`src/data/programStore.ts` builds the exercise library from `EXERCISES` on first load, running a one-time migration to strip stale duplicate IDs (the old `-d1/-d2/-d4` suffixed IDs).

---

## Decisions & things to keep in mind

- **DB writes only at "Finish Workout"** — sets are pure React state until save. This makes inline editing/deletion free (no DB rollback needed).
- **Edit session flow** — "Edit Session" in history opens WorkoutView with `existingSessionId`. On save it deletes all old set logs for that session and re-writes them.
- **Exercise library never deletes** — removing an exercise from a day keeps it in the localStorage library so history can still resolve the name by ID.
- **Difficulty rating was removed** — the Easy/Medium/Hard buttons were removed. The `exerciseLogs` IDB store still exists but nothing writes to it.
- **Program start date** is user-configurable in Settings (`settings.ts`, default `2026-06-09`).
  Changing it only affects the week numbering of *new* sessions — historical sessions keep the
  `weekNumber` they were stored with.
- **Settings are device-local** — `liftlog_settings` and `liftlog_rest_seconds` are not synced,
  same as exercise metadata.
- **`e.stopPropagation()`** is used on nested buttons (Edit, ×) inside tappable cards to prevent triggering parent onClick.
- **White screen with no terminal error** after adding new files = Vite HMR confusion. Fix: hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) + restart dev server.
- **Exercise ID migration** — old builds used `-d1`/`-d2`/`-d4` suffixed IDs for exercises that appeared in multiple days. The remap lives in `src/data/legacyIds.ts` (`LEGACY_ID_MAP`/`canonicalizeId`). It is applied in **two** places that must stay in sync: `migrateExerciseIds()` in `database.ts` (set logs — run before any code that reads set logs by exercise ID) **and** `getStoredProgram()` in `programStore.ts` (the stored program on every read). Fixing only the set logs is not enough: if the stored program still holds a legacy ID, every new workout re-creates legacy-ID set logs, so both must be canonicalized.
